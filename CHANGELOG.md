## Migration Notes

### From v1.0.0 to v2.0.0
This is a major architectural change that transforms the static website into a full-stack application with authentication:

1. **Database Required**: Set up PostgreSQL (production) or use SQLite (development)
2. **Environment Variables**: Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure
3. **SMTP Configuration**: Set up email service for notifications (optional)
4. **Admin Account**: Default admin created automatically on first run
5. **User Registration**: All users must register and be approved by admin

### Backward Compatibility
- ‚ùå **Breaking Change**: Site content now requires authentication
- ‚úÖ **Visual Compatibility**: Same design and branding maintained
- ‚úÖ **Content Preserved**: All original content accessible after login
- ‚úÖ **URLs Maintained**: Same page structure and navigation

### Deployment Changes
- **Render**: Now uses Node.js service + PostgreSQL database (was static)
- **Docker**: Updated for Express.js application (still supported)
- **Environment**: Requires environment variable configuration
