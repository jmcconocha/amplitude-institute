# Draft Sprint

Absolutely, Jeffrey. Here's a detailed design for your **The Amplitude Institute Pilot Sprint**‚Äîa 5-day collaborative R&D experience that balances deep technical exploration with structured IP generation. It‚Äôs modular, high-energy, and tailored for software engineers with hardware fluency.

## üß™ The Amplitude Institute Pilot Sprint: "Invent at the Edge"

**Theme**: Innovation at the intersection of embedded systems, AI, and secure compute

**Duration**: 5 days (can be adapted to 3 or 7)

**Participants**: 8‚Äì12 engineers (software + hardware blend)

**Goal**: Generate 2‚Äì3 patentable concepts and 1 publishable technical artifact

## üóìÔ∏è Sprint Structure Overview

| Day | Focus | Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Kickoff + Problem Framing | Challenge briefs, team formation |
| 2 | Exploration & Ideation | Concept sketches, feasibility notes |
| 3 | Prototyping & Testing | Early-stage demos, failure logs |
| 4 | Refinement + IP Vetting | Patent drafts, technical write-ups |
| 5 | Showcase + Debrief | Presentations, feedback, next steps |

## üîß Day-by-Day Breakdown

### **Day 1: Kickoff + Problem Framing**

- Icebreaker: ‚ÄúDebugging the Impossible‚Äù (fun analogy-based warmup)
- Briefs: Present 3 curated challenge areas (e.g. secure boot for edge devices, AI inference under 1W, firmware observability)
- Team Formation: Self-select into pods based on interest
- Output: Challenge brief refinement + sprint goals

### **Day 2: Exploration & Ideation**

- Research Jam: Review existing patents, papers, and market gaps
- Brainstorming: Use analogical triggers (e.g. photography, music, debugging metaphors)
- Output: 2‚Äì3 concept sketches per pod + feasibility notes

### **Day 3: Prototyping & Testing**

- Build Time: Rapid prototyping with mock APIs, firmware stubs, or simulation tools
- Failure Logging: Track what breaks and why (valuable for IP)
- Output: Demo artifacts + test logs

### **Day 4: Refinement + IP Vetting**

- IP Workshop: Intro to patent strategy, prior art, and claims
- Drafting: Begin provisional patent outlines with support
- Output: 1‚Äì2 patent drafts + technical write-ups

### **Day 5: Showcase + Debrief**

- Presentations: 10-minute pitch per pod (problem, solution, novelty)
- Feedback: From advisors, peers, and potential funders
- Debrief: What worked, what to improve, what to pursue
- Output: Sprint report + roadmap for next phase

## üß© Roles & Facilitation

| Role | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Sprint Facilitator | Guides flow, energy curve, and time-boxing |
| Technical Advisor | Provides domain expertise and feasibility checks |
| IP Mentor | Helps shape patentable ideas and claims |
| Ops Lead | Handles logistics, tools, and documentation |

You could easily take the lead as Sprint Facilitator, given your strengths in analogical thinking, energy curve design, and modular planning.

---

## üì¶ Deliverables

- 2‚Äì3 provisional patent drafts
- 1 technical white paper or blog post
- 1 sprint report (internal use)
- Optional: open-source prototype or demo video

---

## üß† Optional Enhancements

- **Cue Cards**: For ideation triggers and analogies
- **Energy Curve**: Map high/low intensity moments to keep engagement
- **Contingency Plan**: In case tech fails, pivot to design simulation or IP refinement

Would you like this turned into a printable run sheet or a facilitation guide next? I can also help you design the cue cards or build a sprint dashboard for tracking progress. Let‚Äôs make this real.
