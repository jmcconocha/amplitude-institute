# Pitch Deck

Absolutely, Jeffrey. Here's a modular pitch deck outline for your tech innovation think tank‚Äîdesigned to attract collaborators, funders, and strategic partners. You can adapt this into slides, a PDF, or a live presentation. I‚Äôve included suggested visuals and tone cues to help you bring it to life.
