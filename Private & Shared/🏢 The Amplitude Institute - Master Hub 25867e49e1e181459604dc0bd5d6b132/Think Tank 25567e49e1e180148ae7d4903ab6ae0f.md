# Think Tank

That‚Äôs a bold and exciting vision, Jeffrey‚Äîand absolutely feasible with the right structure, funding strategy, and clarity of purpose. A tech-focused think tank aimed at innovation and patent generation is a hybrid model that blends research, entrepreneurship, and strategic collaboration. Let‚Äôs break it down:

## üß† Feasibility of a Tech Innovation Think Tank

Yes, it‚Äôs feasible‚Äîespecially for someone like you who thrives on modular design, analogical thinking, and engaging technical minds. But feasibility depends on:

- **Clear mission and scope**: Focus on a few high-impact domains (e.g. edge computing, AI/ML tooling, embedded systems) to start.
- **Talent alignment**: Software engineers with hardware fluency are ideal for cross-disciplinary innovation.
- **IP strategy**: You‚Äôll need a process for vetting ideas, filing patents, and possibly licensing or spinning off technologies.
- **Legal and governance setup**: A nonprofit or hybrid structure can work, but IP ownership and commercialization rights must be clearly defined.

## üí∞ Funding Options

Here are viable funding streams for a tech think tank:

| Funding Source | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Corporate Sponsorships** | Partner with tech firms seeking R&D insights or patent pipelines. |
| **Government Grants** | Apply for innovation-focused programs (e.g. NSF, DARPA, SBIR/STTR). |
| **Philanthropic Foundations** | Some support tech innovation for public good (e.g. Mozilla, Sloan). |
| **University Partnerships** | Co-locate or collaborate with academic labs for shared resources. |
| **Consulting & Training** | Offer workshops or advisory services to generate revenue. |
| **Membership Model** | Charge for access to exclusive reports, events, or early-stage IP. |
| **Angel Investors / VCs** | If you spin off startups, this becomes a viable path for funding growth. |

You can also explore [creative funding models](https://buildathinktank.org/finance-and-funding/) like renting out lab space, offering paid courses, or publishing premium research.

## üèóÔ∏è Basic Structure of a Think Tank

Here‚Äôs a modular structure tailored to your goals:

### 1. **Governance**

- **Board of Directors**: Strategic oversight, fundraising, and credibility.
- **Executive Director**: Operational leadership and vision alignment.

### 2. **Core Teams**

- **Research & Innovation**: Software/hardware engineers working in pods on emerging tech.
- **IP & Legal**: Patent filing, licensing, and compliance.
- **Partnerships & Outreach**: Building relationships with industry, academia, and funders.
- **Operations & Admin**: Budgeting, HR, workspace management.

### 3. **Advisory Council**

- Experts from academia, industry, and law to guide direction and validate ideas.

### 4. **Project Pods**

- Small, agile teams focused on specific challenges (e.g. low-power AI chips, secure firmware, etc.).

### 5. **Knowledge Dissemination**

- Publish white papers, host events, and contribute to open-source or standards bodies.

## üîÑ Startup Strategy: Think‚ÄìPlan‚ÄìStart‚ÄìAdapt

This framework is widely recommended for new think tanks:

1. **Think**: Clarify your mission, values, and intended impact.
2. **Plan**: Define your business model, governance, and funding strategy.
3. **Start**: Launch with a pilot project or small team.
4. **Adapt**: Monitor progress, iterate, and refine based on feedback.

## üß© Next Steps for You

Given your strengths in facilitation and modular design, you could start with:

- A **pilot workshop or innovation sprint** with a few trusted engineers.
- A **white paper or concept note** outlining your think tank‚Äôs vision and value proposition.
- A **draft governance model** and IP framework to attract collaborators and funders.
